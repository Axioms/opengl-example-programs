
Q1

If we were to put the rgb numbers without making it fit into the range of 0.0 to 1.0 
then would assume that any number above 1.0 is equivalent to 1.0. Which means if the rgb numbers were put in 
we would see an opaque white square.

Q2

Dividing the color numbers by 255 will show a black square because we are doing integer division 
which results in an integer and not a float or double.

Q3

After moving the point to (0,0,-0.75) it is still visable and has not moved.

Q4

After moving the point to (0,0,-2.3) the point is no longer visable because the position has 
a range of -1.0 to 1.0 and anything above or below that range is off screen.
